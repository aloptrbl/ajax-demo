# A formal AJAX practice 

AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.
allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes.

AJAX just uses a combination of:

1.A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)

2.JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)
